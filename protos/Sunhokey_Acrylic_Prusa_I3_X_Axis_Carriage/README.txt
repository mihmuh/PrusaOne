# Summary

The stock carriage offers a very weak hotend mount and causes vibrations. This replaces that carriage.  

!!! ENSURE YOU RE-ZERO YOUR Z STOP BEFORE HOMING PRINTER!!!

New solidworks files allow for a set of modifications.

- added head magnets for accessories
- hot-swappable hotend attachment
- new mount for a small engraving tool
- smaller width to allow for more bed coverage

Print one x carriage, 1 hotend mount, and 2 belt clamps  

These parts should all print without support material.  

You need to buy 2 M4 x 40mm screws to install hotend and 4 M3 x 12mm screws for belt clamps  

!!! ENSURE YOU RE-ZERO YOUR Z STOP BEFORE HOMING PRINTER!!!  

ASSEMBLY TIPS:

Press hotend into hotend clamp and slide into place.  

Use 2 M4 x 40mm screws to pass through carriage into pillow block and clamp hotend firmly. (2 reliefs in hotend clamp to allow the trapping of hotend wires to prevent strain)
